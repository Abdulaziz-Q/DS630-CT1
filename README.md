# DS630-CT1
Critical Thinking Assignment 1 is part of DS630 (Artificial Intelligence for Data Science) course

### CT1: Dijkstra’s algorithm 

In this activity, critical thinking assignment 1, we will construct a map of air and land distances with direct routes between the cities listed in table 1. we will create two graphs (maps) that connect the cities to each other, one to measure travel time between routes in land, the other one to measure travel time between cities in the air with the help of many tools that we will explain in this critical thinking. Then apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to a destination node. The source will be always my city Riyadh and other cities will be the destinations.
